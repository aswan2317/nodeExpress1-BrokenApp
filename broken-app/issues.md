### Issues with the Original Code

1. **Lack of Error Handling**: The original code did not properly handle errors, such as invalid input or failed requests.
2. **No Input Validation**: There was no validation for the input to ensure it was in the correct format.
3. **Poor Code Structure**: The code was not modular and did not follow best practices for organizing Express applications.
4. **No Documentation**: The code lacked comments and documentation, making it difficult to understand and maintain.
5. **No Error Handling Middleware**: The application did not include middleware to handle errors centrally.

### Improvements Made

1. **Implemented Error Handling**: Added try-catch blocks and error handling middleware to manage errors gracefully.
2. **Added Input Validation**: Validated the input to ensure it is an array of GitHub usernames.
3. **Modularized Code**: Refactored the code to use Express Router for better organization.
4. **Added Comments and Documentation**: Documented the code to explain the purpose and functionality of different parts.
5. **Centralized Error Handling**: Added error handling middleware for consistent error responses.
